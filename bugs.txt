JS browser scripts:

1. Thrown Exceptions never silence EventListeners
 - the code in the eventlistener is executed even after the error is thrown
 reason:
 - errors in my code are thrown mostly by failed FetchAPI request ->
   those are caught straight away and the function continues!

2. If no transactions for user are present, multiple endpoints fail to account for it
 - fetch endpoint still sends json with no transactions
 - monthly saldo endpoint crashes
